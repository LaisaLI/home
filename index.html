        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>In the past year, my pursuit of understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) has been fueled by a profound personal interest. My recent research includes LLMs as interactive database interface systems for designing large SQL queries, submitted to the HILDA 2024 workshop co-located with SIGMOD 2024 as first author. Additionally, I collaborated on a project that harnessed LLMs for paper scheduling challenges, exemplified by my role as the second author in AIware 2024.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, my tenure as a data scientist has equipped me with foundational skills in statistics, machine learning, and mathematical optimization, providing a robust foundation for my research pursuits. Leveraging this background, I am enthusiastic about applying to the Ph.D. program at The University of Hong Kong, commencing in Fall 2025, to further advance my expertise and contribute meaningfully to the research landscape. My proposed research aims to understand In-Context Learning by Decoding the Mechanisms to improve the reliability and transparency.</p>
